## Evil Hangman
A seemingly regular version of Hangman you just can't seem to win.

Powered by not deciding on a word straight away, and making sure your guesses lead to as many potential solutions as possible.

You can use a custom word list (maybe in your native language, if you'd like), by swapping out the `words.txt` file. Should be a list of words separated by a Unix newline.
